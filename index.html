        <td>After a pair of quiet years, Japan has reopened its borders, and Tokyo’s distinct energy is back in full force. There's so much to see, including new shopping megaplexes, elegant hotels, and restaurants with rising-star chefs at their helms. <br>Locals and visitors are once again rushing to futuristic skyscrapers and the famous Shibuya Crossing, an intersection that's so lively, it feels like a flash mob. But these places are a bit less hectic in winter and early spring. <br>Even better, March and April bring cherry blossom season, when the whole city slows down to stroll past thousands of pink blossoms. <br>You can find other quiet moments in ancient Buddhist temples and peaceful gardens, or those secret ramen counters, chill record bars, and other little gems often hiding in plain sight.</td>

        <td>Sidney</td>
        <td>With towering skyscrapers and landmarks, Sydney has all the big-city energy—but with a twist. <br>Its easy access to nature (surf spots and bushwalks are right at your fingertips) means there’s plenty of breathing room, too. <br>And summertime (through February) brings everyone out and exploring. <br>The city makes the most of the weather, frontloading the calendar with events like the Sydney Festival, Chinese New Year, and WorldPride. <br>But of course, its iconic Opera House and its cliff-top coastal walks are amazing any time of year. <br>Take a ride up the Sydney Tower Eye, and it’ll give you a top-down view on the city and all its attractions. <br>But leave some time to relax as locals do, whether that’s sunbathing on Bondi Beach or sipping a flat white in one of the city’s coffee shops.</td>

        <td>Paris</td>
        <td>Paris has a reputation for being the ultimate romantic getaway. But what visitors really swoon over is the city itself. <br>Those grand stone and wrought-iron buildings, the sidewalks brimming with cozy cafés, and the Seine’s curving riverbanks are downright cinematic. <br>But the city’s charms go beyond looks. The culinary scene creates an endless list of must-eat French dishes—rich and hearty coq au vin, golden buttery croissants. <br>It’s also worth trying modern fusion and inventive international food here. (Trust us, the city’s falafel is outstanding.) <br>And the spirit of Paris invites ducking down side streets, lingering in museums, and exploring mazes of shops. <br>At the end of the day, head to the Champ-de-Mars to get uninterrupted views of the Eiffel Tower as it glitters into the night.</td>

        <td>New York</td>
        <td>The tallest buildings, biggest museums, and best pizza—NYC is a city of superlatives, and it lives up to every one of them. <br>From the dazzling spectacle of Broadway to MoMA’s world-class galleries, the boutiques of SoHo, and the array of restaurants offering cuisines from every corner of the world, there’s a different New York to discover every time you visit. <br>Beyond those iconic landmarks, though, New York’s secret side awaits. <br>You’re likely to stumble upon indie vintage shops and locals-only brunch spots even on the shortest of strolls. <br>And when the crowds and noise are too much to take, just look up—that skyline will remind you why you came in the first place.</td>

        <td>London</td>
        <td>London is layered with history, where medieval and Victorian complement a rich and vibrant modern world. <br>The Tower of London and Westminster neighbor local pubs and markets, and time-worn rituals like the changing of the guards take place as commuters rush to catch the Tube. <br>It’s a place where travelers can time-hop through the city, and when they’re weary, do as Londoners do and grab a “cuppa” tea.</td>
